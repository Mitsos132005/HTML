<p>Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, not all of which are closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just 14 species can be foundâ€”2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia. It is nicknamed the king of all birds.</p>
