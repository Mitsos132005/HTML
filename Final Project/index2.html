  <p>Lemmy had a strange personal life, he was never married yet he has slept with more than 1000 women. At the age of 17 he had a son who was given for adoption. His son Sean only started regrouping with his parents later in life. Lemmy said in a documentary that the most precious thing in his house is his son who was next to to him.</p>
  <p>Lemmy always had problems when dealing with drugs, he claims that he had done all kinds of drugs, except Heroin, because a girlfriend that he loved a lot died from overdose. Lemmy was chain smoking from the age of 12 and was drinking one Jack Daniels whiskey every day since he was 30. It really is a miracle that he manage to live up to 70 years old. A magazine declared that its impossible that he is alive. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer 3 days before his death.<p/>
  <p>His last wish was to be cremated and some of his ashes to be put inside bullet shells and given to his closest friends.<p/>
